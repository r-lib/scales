* `floor_time` calls `to_time`, but that function was moved into a function
  so it was no longer available in the scales namespace. Now `floor_time`
  has its own copy of that function. (Thanks to Stefan Novak)

* Color palettes generated by `brewer_pal` no longer give warnings when fewer
  than 3 colors are requested. (Winston Chang)

* `abs_area and `rescale_max` functions have been added, for scaling the area
  of points to be proportional to their value. These are used by
  `scale_size_area` in ggplot2.


Version 0.2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `zero_range` has improved behaviour thanks to Brian Diggs.

* `brewer_pal` complains if you give it an incorrect palette type. (Fixes #15,
  thanks to Jean-Olivier Irisson)

* `shape_pal` warns if asked for more than 6 values. (Fixes #16, thanks to
  Jean-Olivier Irisson)

* `time_trans` gains an optional argument `tz` to specify the time zone to use
  for the times.  If not specified, it will be guess from the first input with
  a non-null time zone.

* `date_trans` and `time_trans` now check that their inputs are of the correct
   type.  This prevents ggplot2 scales from silently giving incorrect outputs
   when given incorrect inputs.

* Change the default breaks algorithm for `cbreaks()` and `trans_new()`.
  Previously it was `pretty_breaks()`, and now it's `extended_breaks()`,
  which uses the `extended()` algorithm from the labeling package.

* fixed namespace problem with `fullseq`

Version 0.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `suppressWarnings` from `train_continuous` so zero-row or all infinite data
  frames don't potentially cause problems.

* check for zero-length colour in `gradient_n_pal`

* added `extended_breaks` which implements an extension to Wilkinson's
  labelling approach, as implemented in the `labeling` package.  This should
  generally produce nicer breaks than `pretty_breaks`.

* `alpha` can now preserve existing alpha values if `alpha` is missing.

* `log_breaks` always gives breaks evenly spaced on the log scale, never
  evenly spaced on the data scale. This will result in really bad breaks for
  some ranges (e.g 0.5-0.6), but you probably shouldn't be using log scales in
  that situation anyway.

Version 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `censor` and `squish` gain `only.finite` argument and default to operating
  only on finite values. This is needed for ggplot2, and reflects the use of
  Inf and -Inf as special values.

* `bounds` functions now `force` evaluation of range to avoid bug with S3
  method dispatch inside primitive functions (e.g. `[`)

* Simplified algorithm for `discrete_range` that is robust to
  `stringsAsFactors` global option.  Now, the order of a factor will only be 
  preserved if the full factor is the first object seen, and all subsequent 
  inputs are subsets of the levels of the original factor.

* `scientific` ensures output is always in scientific format and off the
  specified number of significant digits. `comma` ensures output is never in
  scientific format. (Fixes #7)

* Another tweak to `zero_range` to better detect when a range has zero length.
  (Fixes #6)
