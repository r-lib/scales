#' Breaks for log axes
#'
#' This algorithm starts by looking for integer powers of `base`. If that
#' doesn't provide enough breaks, it then looks for additional intermediate
#' breaks which are integer multiples of integer powers of base. If that fails
#' (which it can for very small ranges), we fall back to [extended_breaks()]
#'
#' @details
#' The algorithm starts by looking for a set of integer powers of `base` that
#' cover the range of the data. If that does not generate at least `n - 2`
#' breaks, we look for an integer between 1 and `base` that splits the interval
#' approximately in half. For example, in the case of `base = 10`, this integer
#' is 3 because `log10(3) = 0.477`. This leaves 2 intervals: `c(1, 3)` and
#' `c(3, 10)`. If we still need more breaks, we look for another integer
#' that splits the largest remaining interval (on the log-scale) approximately
#' in half. For `base = 10`, this is 5 because `log10(5) = 0.699`.
#'
#' The generic algorithm starts with a set of integers `steps` containing
#' only 1 and a set of candidate integers containing all integers larger than 1
#' and smaller than `base`. Then for each remaining candidate integer
#' `x`, the smallest interval (on the log-scale) in the vector
#' `sort(c(x, steps, base))` is calculated. The candidate `x` which
#' yields the largest minimal interval is added to `steps` and removed from
#' the candidate set. This is repeated until either a sufficient number of
#' breaks, `>= n-2`, are returned or all candidates have been used.
